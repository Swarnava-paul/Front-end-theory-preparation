1. What is React?

--> React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications where data changes over time.


2. What are the main features of React?

-->JSX (JavaScript XML)
-->Components
-->Virtual DOM
-->One-way data binding
-->High performance


3. What is JSX?

JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to XML or HTML. It allows you to write HTML directly within JavaScript and is transformed into React elements.



4. What is a React Component?

A React component is a building block of a React application. It can be a class-based or functional component. It returns a React element that describes what should appear on the screen.



5. What is the difference between a functional component and a class component?

Functional components are stateless components defined as functions. Class components are stateful and defined as ES6 classes that extend from React.Component.


6. What is the Virtual DOM?

The Virtual DOM is an in-memory representation of the real DOM elements generated by React components. React uses the Virtual DOM to optimize updates by only re-rendering nodes that have changed.




7. What is state in React?

State is an object that holds data that may change over the lifecycle of the component. State is managed within the component (or via hooks) and can be updated using setState in class components or the useState hook in functional components.


8. What are props in React?

Props (short for properties) are read-only inputs passed from a parent component to a child component. They are used to pass data and event handlers to child components.



9. What are React Hooks?

Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components. Common hooks include useState, useEffect, useContext, useReducer, and useMemo.

10. What is the useState hook?

useState is a hook that lets you add state to functional components. It returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function to update it.


11. What is the useEffect hook?

useEffect is a hook that allows you to perform side effects in functional components. It takes a function and an optional dependency array. The function runs after the render and can clean up by returning another function.


12. How does the Context API work?

The Context API provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. It consists of React.createContext, Context.Provider, and Context.Consumer.



13. What are Higher-Order Components (HOC)?

HOCs are functions that take a component and return a new component with additional props or functionality. They are used for code reuse, logic, and bootstrap abstraction.


14. What is the significance of keys in React?

Keys help React identify which items have changed, been added, or removed. They should be given to elements inside a list to provide a stable identity.


12. How can you optimize performance in a React application?

Memoizing components with React.memo
Using useMemo and useCallback hooks
Implementing code-splitting with React.lazy and Suspense
Avoiding unnecessary re-renders
Keeping component state local where necessary







13. What is Redux and how does it work with React?

Redux is a state management library that provides a central store for state management and predictable state updates with actions and reducers. It works with React through bindings provided by react-redux.


14. Explain the concept of Redux middleware?

Middleware in Redux provides a way to extend Redux with custom functionality. It intercepts actions before they reach the reducer, allowing for logging, asynchronous actions, etc.


15. What is server-side rendering (SSR) in React?

SSR is the process of rendering React components on the server and sending HTML to the client, which improves performance and SEO. Frameworks like Next.js facilitate SSR in React.


16. What are React portals and how are they used?

React portals provide a way to render children into a DOM node outside the hierarchy of the parent component. This is useful for modals, tooltips, and other components that need to visually break out of the parent container.


17. How do you handle forms in React?

Forms in React can be controlled or uncontrolled. Controlled components maintain their state via React state, while uncontrolled components rely on refs to manage the form data.


18. What are error boundaries in React?

Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of crashing the whole app.


19. What is the difference between useEffect and useLayoutEffect?

useEffect runs asynchronously and after the paint, whereas useLayoutEffect runs synchronously before the browser paint, which can be useful for reading layout from the DOM and synchronously re-rendering.


20. What are React Fragments?

React Fragments allow you to return multiple elements from a component without adding extra nodes to the DOM. They are written with <React.Fragment> or the shorthand <>...</>.
